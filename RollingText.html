                    Several baby animals are living in a jungle, where they explore on a 
                    daily basis aspects of their lives in their adventures and interactions  
                    with their parents and grandparents. At the end of each episode, they come 
                    to some fresh understanding about their lives. Sometimes they have to admit 
                    the child-world mistakes they make. They learn, for instance, that trusting 
                    their parents and telling them the truth from the scratch is always the 
                    right thing to do and is the better option compared to hiding facts and 
                    lying to them. The collective nature of these experiences, which involves
                    them all, is what makes the animated series a special and lifelike story.
